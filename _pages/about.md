I am a second-year Ph.D. student at [PCNI Lab](http://pcni.pku.edu.cn/) of the School of Electronics, Peking University, supervised by [Prof. Xiang Cheng](https://ele.pku.edu.cn/info/1023/1063.htm). I also work closely with [Prof. Shijian Gao](https://sites.google.com/view/shijian-gao) from HKUST-GZ. 
Before that, I obtained my bachelor's degree in the [School of Information and Communication Engineering](https://www.sice.uestc.edu.cn/) from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2023.

My research interests include AI-empowered wireless system design and mmWave/terahertz transceiver optimization. Specifically, I have recently focused on the wireless physical layer (PHY) design enabled by foundation models.
